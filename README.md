# TiO2-nanoparticles

In summary, the global minimum search was conducted with an evolutionary algorithm implemented in the USPEX code to find the most stable (TiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> nanoparticles with n = 2â€“20  using the PM6-D3 semi-empirical method, exploring more than 60,000 structures. From the evolutionary algorithm results, the candidate clusters with the lowest energy were re-optimized using density functional theory within the GGA approach. In the last step, the ground state for each cluster size was again optimized with the PBE0/def2-TZVP level of theory to calculate the total energy. Effective core potentials (ECP) for describing the Ti and O core electrons were used through all calculations with the PBE0 functional. The valence electrons of Ti (3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>3d<sup>2</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>) and O (2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup>) were described with the def2-TZVP basis set (Triple-Zeta Valence with Polarization).
